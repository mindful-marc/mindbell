	<!-- Main window -->
	<string name="explanation">The Mindfulness Bell rings periodically during the day,
	 to give you the opportunity to hold on for a moment and consider what you are 
	 currently doing, and in what state of mind you are while you are doing it. 
	 According to the Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, this is an effective 
	 means of developing mindfulness.</string>

	<string name="howToSet">To activate the bell, use the menu button.</string>
